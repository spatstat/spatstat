SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o ppm, kppm, lppm
   NEW SYNTAX FOR POINT PROCESS MODELS
   The model-fitting functions 'ppm', 'kppm' and 'lppm' now accept
   a syntax similar to 'lm' or 'glm', for example  ppm(X ~ Z), 
   but still accept the older syntax ppm(X, ~Z). 
   To support both kinds of syntax, the functions 'ppm' and 'kppm'
   are now generic, with methods for the classes 'formula', 'ppp' and 'quad'. 
   The 'formula' method handles a syntax like ppm(X ~ Z) while the
   'ppp' method handles the old syntax ppm(X, ~Z).
   Similarly 'lppm' is generic with methods for 'formula' and 'lpp'.

   o ppm, kppm, lppm
   Covariates appearing in the model formula can be objects 
   which exist in the R session, instead of always having to be
   elements of the list `covariates'.
   
   o ppm.formula, kppm.formula, lppm.formula
   Formulae involving polynom() are now expanded, symbolically,
   so that polynom(x, 3) becomes x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) 
   and polynom(x,y,2) becomes x + y + I(x^2) + I(x*y) + I(y^2).
   This neatens the model output, and also makes it possible
   for anova() and step() to add or delete single terms in the polynomial.

   o predict.ppm
   New argument 'interval' allows confidence intervals or prediction intervals
   to be calculated.

   o predict.ppm
   New argument 'total' allows for prediction of the total number of points
   in a specified region.
   
   o plot.ppp, plot.lpp
   For marked point patterns, a legend is automatically added
   to the plot, by default. Arguments have changed: new arguments
   include parameters of the legend, and an optional symbol map.
   Result has changed: it is now an object of class 'symbolmap'.

   o plot.ppp, plot.lpp
   Interpretation of the parameters 'markscale' and 'maxsize' 
   has changed. The size of a circle in the plot is now defined 
   as the circle's diameter instead of its radius. (Size of
   a square is measured, as before, by its side length). 

   o parres
   Now handles the case where the fitted model is not separable
   but its restriction to the given 'subregion' is separable.

   o envelope
   Now issues a warning if the usage of envelope() appears to be `invalid' 
   in the sense that the simulated patterns and the data pattern
   have not been treated equally.

   o Kinhom, Finhom, Ginhom, Jinhom
   New argument 'update'.
   If 'lambda' is a fitted model (class ppm or kppm) and update=TRUE,
   the model is re-fitted to the data pattern, before the intensities
   are computed.

   o rDiggleGratton, rDGS, rHardcore, rStrauss, rStraussHard
   By default the point pattern is now generated on
   a larger window, and trimmed to the original window.
   New argument expand=TRUE.

   o MultiStrauss, MultiHard, MultiStraussHard
   The syntax of these functions has changed.
   The new code should still accept the old syntax.

   o rhohat
   rhohat.ppp and rhohat.quad have new argument 'baseline'

   o ippm
   Algorithm improved. Argument syntax changed.

   o default.dummy, quadscheme
   Dummy points can now be generated by a quasirandom sequence.

   o plot.owin
   The window can now be filled with one of 8 different textures.
   Arguments changed. 

   o ppm, kppm
   Covariates in the model can now be tessellations.

   o [.im
   New argument 'tight' allows the resulting image to be trimmed 
   to the smallest possible rectangle.

   o [.psp, rlinegrid, rpoisline
   These functions now handle binary mask windows.

   o rotate
   The user can specify the centre of rotation.

   o rescale
   rescale() and all its methods now have argument 'unitname'
   which can be used to change the name of the unit of length.

   o anova.ppm
   Output format has been improved. 
   Number of columns of result has changed.

   o print.ppp, print.summary.ppp, print.owin, print.summary.owin,
   print.im, print.summary.im, print.fv, print.msr, print.profilepl
   These functions now avoid over-running the text margin
   (i.e. they respect options('width') where possible).

   o layerplotargs<-
   Now handles any spatial object, converting it to a 'layered' object.

   o effectfun
   Improved display in case se.fit=TRUE.

   o scaletointerval
   New argument 'xrange'

   o contour.im
   New argument 'show.all'.
   Default value of 'axes' changed to FALSE.

   o identify.ppp
   Now handles multivariate marks. 

   o plot.listof
   Improved layout.
   New arguments 'hsep', 'vsep'.
   Argument 'mar.panel' may have length 1, 2 or 4.

   o plot.splitppp

   o Kinhom
   Now accepts correction="good"

   will be displayed in colour or in greyscale. This will eventually be
   applied to all plot commands in spatstat. 

   o plot.im, persp.im, contour.im, plot.owin, plot.psp, plot.fv, plot.fasp
   These functions now obey spatstat.options('monochrome')

   o plot.ppp, plot.owin, plot.im, plot.psp, plot.tess, plot.layered

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o plot.hyperframe
   The argument 'e' now has a different format.

   because contributions to the pcf estimate from interpoint distances
   greater than max(r) were mistakenly omitted. 
   Spotted by Rasmus Waagepetersen and Abdollah Jalilian. 
   Bug was always present.
   Fixed.

   o demo(spatstat)

   Fixed.

   o predict.ppm
   Crashed if the model was fitted using 'covfunargs'.

	CHANGES IN spatstat VERSION 1.33-0

OVERVIEW

   o We thank Kurt Hornik and Brian Ripley for advice.

   o The package namespace has been modified.

   o Numerous internal changes.

   o Likelihood cross-validation for smoothing bandwidth.

   o More flexible models of intensity in cluster/Cox processes.

   o New generic function for smoothing.

   o Version nickname: 'Titanic Deckchair'

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o bw.ppl
    Likelihood cross-validation technique 
    for bandwidth selection in kernel smoothing.

    o is.lppm, is.kppm, is.slrm
    Tests whether an object is of class 'lppm', 'kppm' or 'slrm'

    o Smooth
    New generic function for spatial smoothing.

    o Smooth.ppp, Smooth.fv, Smooth.msr
    Methods for Smooth
    (identical to smooth.ppp, smooth.fv, smooth.msr respectively)

    o fitted.kppm
    Method for 'fitted' for cluster/Cox models

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o namespace
    The namespace of the spatstat package has been changed.

    o internal functions
    Some undocumented internal functions are no longer visible,
    as they are no longer exported in the namespace. These functions
    can still be accessed using the form spatstat:::functionname.
    Functions that are not visible are not guaranteed to exist 
    or to remain the same in future. 

    o methods
    For some generic functions defined in the spatstat package,
    it is possible that R may fail to find one of the methods
    for the generic. This is a temporary problem due to a restriction
    on the size of the namespace in R 3.0.1. It will be fixed in 
    future versions of R and spatstat. It only applies to methods
    for a generic which is a spatstat function (such as nndist)
    and does not apply to methods for generics defined elsewhere
    (such as density). In the meantime, if this problem should occur, 
    it can be avoided by calling the method explicitly, in the form
    spatstat:::genericname.classname.

    o speed
    The package should run slightly faster overall, due to the
    improvement of the namespace, and changes to internal code.

    o envelope
    New argument 'envir.simul' determines the environment
    in which to evaluate the expression 'simulate'.

    o kppm
    More flexible models of the intensity, and greater control over the
    intensity fitting procedure, are now possible using the arguments
    'covfunargs', 'use.gam', 'nd', 'eps' passed to ppm.
    Also the argument 'X' may now be a quadrature scheme.

    o distcdf
    Arguments W and V can now be point patterns.

    o Kest
    New option: correction = "good" 
    selects the best edge correction that can be computed in reasonable time.

    o bw.diggle
    Accelerated.

    o predict.ppm
    Calculation of standard error has been accelerated.

    o smooth.ppp, smooth.fv, smooth.msr
    These functions will soon be 'Deprecated' in favour of
    the methods Smooth.ppp, Smooth.fv, Smooth.msr respectively.

    o stratrand, overlap.owin, update.slrm, edge.Trans, edge.Ripley
    These already-existing functions are now documented.

BUG FIXES

    o kppm, matclust.estpcf, pcfmodel
    The pair correlation function of the Matern Cluster Process
    was evaluated incorrectly at distances close to 0.
    This could have affected the fitted parameters 
    in matclust.estpcf() or kppm(clusters="MatClust").
    Fixed.

    o anova.ppm
    Would cause an error in future versions of R
    when 'anova.glm' is removed from the namespace.
    Fixed.

   Crashed if the model was fitted using split pixels.
   Fixed.

   o residuals.ppm, diagnose.ppm
   Did not always correctly handle models that included offset terms.
   Fixed.

   o project.ppm
   When a model was projected by project.ppm or by ppm(project=TRUE),
   the edge corrections used the projected models were sometimes different

  New argument 'alternative' allows choice of alternative hypothesis
  and returns one-sided or two-sided p-values as appropriate.

  (for use in small samples where the chi^2 approximation is inaccurate)

  o Softcore
  Improved numerical stability.
  New argument 'sigma0' for manual control over rescaling.

   Fits the stationary Strauss point process model
   using an exact maximum pseudolikelihood technique.

   o plot.fv
   If a formula was used to specify the plot,
   the names of variables in the formula were sometimes
   incorrectly matched to *functions*.
   Spotted by Farzaneh Safavimanesh.

   Took a very long time if the containing box was very flat,
   due to the default value of 'vside'.

   Output improved.

BUG FIXES

   o linearK, linearKinhom
   If any data points were located exactly at a vertex of the 
   linear network, the weights for Ang's correction were incorrect, 
   due to numerical error. This sometimes produced infinite 
   or NA values of the linear K function.
   Fixed.
   
   o predict.ppm
   In some cases, predict.ppm(type="cif") generated a spurious warning 
   that "number of rows of result is not a multiple of vector length."
   Fixed.

   o crossing.psp
   Results were sometimes incorrect due to numerical rounding error
   associated with GCC bug #323.

   For edge corrections other than the border correction,
   an error message about 'rbord' would sometimes occur.
   Fixed.

	CHANGES IN spatstat VERSION 1.26-0

OVERVIEW 

   o We thank Jens Oehlschlaegel for contributions.

   o Further substantial acceleration of spatstat functions.

   o Workaround for bug in RandomFields package.

   o Numerous modifications to internal code.

NEW FUNCTIONS

   o RandomFieldsSafe
   There is a bug in the package 'RandomFields' (version <= 2.0.54)
   which causes a crash to occur, in the development version of R
   but not in R 2.15.0. To avoid crashing spatstat, we have written
   the temporary, undocumented function RandomFieldsSafe() 
   which returns TRUE if it is safe to use the RandomFields package.
